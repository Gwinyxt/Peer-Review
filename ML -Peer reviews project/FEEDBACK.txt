Feedback comments:
Here is the feedback and marks breakdown. 
The report has a clear structure. In the introduction, existing works based on peer review prediction should be
discussed. In the data preparation, most parts are not specific to this coursework but give a general 
description only (except for data splitting). 
In the experiment, it is better to include experimental settings.

Here is the marks breakdown: 
Problem understanding and background research: 11; 
EDA and data preparation: 16; 
ML implementation and experiments: 36; 
Ethical discussion: 6;
